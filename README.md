# The Battle Cats Pop! 3DS .3gx Plugin

These are some cheat codes I made for the 3DS game, The Battle Cats: Pop!
Don't ask why the first release is 2.0.5
This plugin technically supports the USA and PAL versions of the game, but the PAL version wasn't actually ever tested, how nice.
Put the file in luma/plugins/000400000018BC00 or instead of 000400000018BC00 do 000400000018F500 if you have the PAL game, report back if anything works ^^
