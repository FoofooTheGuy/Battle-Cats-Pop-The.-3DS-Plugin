Don't ask why the first release is 2.0.5

3. Put your SD card back into your console and open the rosalina menu (L + D-pad down + select by default) and enable the plugin loader (4th option)

3. Create a folder called "plugins" (without quotes) in the luma folder that is in your SD card root (SD:/luma/plugins/)
