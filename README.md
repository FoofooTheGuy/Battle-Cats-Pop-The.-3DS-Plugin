# The Battle Cats Pop! 3DS .3gx CTRPF 0.7.0 Plugin

These are some cheat codes I made for the 3DS game, The Battle Cats: Pop!
Don't ask why the first release is 2.0.5

# Installation guide:
(You will need to first install Custom Firmware to use this plugin)

Method 1 (Assisted installation using a Windows PC):
---
- Turn off your console and put your SD card into your computer

- If you use a Windows PC, then you can install the plugin by running the Install.bat file, and following the instructions in the command prompt.
- After that, put your SD card back into your console and open the rosalina menu (L + D-pad down + select by default) and enable the plugin loader (4th option)
- Launch The Battle Cats POP!, and the screen will flash a light blue color and the message "Plugin ready!" shall appear soon after.

Method 2 (Manual installation):
---
- Turn off your console and put your SD card into your computer
- First download the boot.firm file for [Luma3DS 3GX Loader Edition](https://github.com/Nanquitas/Luma3DS/releases/latest) and
replace the boot.firm on your SD card root with that one.
- Next create a folder called "plugins" (without quotes) in the luma folder that is in your SD card root (SD:/luma/plugins/)
- Then create a folder corresponding to your game title ID in the plugins folder:

Japan: SD:/luma/plugins/000400000015DA00/

Korea: SD:/luma/plugins/000400000018B500/

USA: SD:/luma/plugins/000400000018BC00/

Europe: SD:/luma/plugins/000400000018F500/

- Place Battle-Cats-Plugin.3gx in that folder (E.g. SD:/luma/plugins/000400000015DA00/Battle-Cats-Plugin.3gx)
- Finally, put your SD card back into your console and open the rosalina menu (L + D-pad down + select by default) and enable the plugin loader (4th option)
- Launch The Battle Cats POP!, and the screen will flash a light blue color and the message "Plugin ready!" shall appear soon after.

Press select to open the menu.
